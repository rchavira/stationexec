::

    * New database capabilities
        * Tool and table to log exceptions during execution - helpful for tracking software issues over time
        * Tool and table to log tool usage - can be used to track maintenance on tools
    * Improved DAG visualization
        * New drawing package used that is more flexible
        * More predictable and controllable layout
    * Ease of use changes for Developers:
        * Ability to display a nicely formatted table showing individual or group tool status
            * Added to all tool UIs
            * Makes adding a table showing the status of a subset of tools to a station page easy
        * localonly mode enforced for 'hello_prpl' example project
        * Check for installed packages - a quick check to ensure all required python packages are present to aid
            the developer in getting started quickly.
        * Added extra checks in operations for when system is shutting down
        * Added experimental force shutdown mode that terminates operations when stopping sequences
    * Copious usability and stability fixes - here are a few:
        * More fixes related to the process -> thread change
        * Improvements to database syncing for performance and stability
        * Gave GetTool a non-blocking mode in case we don't want to halt execution on an unavailable tool
        * Prevent cameras from launching multiple acquisition loops
        * Allow asynctool to directly set tool status to aid responsiveness in status changes
        * Fix sqlite transaction issues plaguing Python 3 runs
        * Only running database sync method when the external database is available
        * Updating built-in jquery to most recent stable version
        * Changing how UUIDs are stored to fix incompatibility between Python 2 and 3 representation of bytes and strings
    * Widespread documentation and style improvements

::

    * Changing architecture of stationexec from multi-process to multi-thread
        * BIG change with primarily beneficial results
        * Support for stationexec on Windows is MUCH more stable
            * Multi-processing is poorly supported on Windows - threading works great
            * Many items like threads and sockets would not work (which makes tool connections hard) - now they do
            * Python 3 on Windows is back on the table! It behaved differently than 2 in multiprocessing - no longer.
        * More complex tools can be supported
            * Tools like cameras that interact with an installed driver on the PC did not appreciate access from
                multiple memory spaces caused huge issues
            * Now we are no longer limited as all threads share the same space
        * Communication between the sequencer and operations is much more stable and less limiting
        * stationexec no longer runs on multiple processors, but is a fairly low-overhead application anyway
    * localonly mode
        * Allows running stations in mode that never connects to external database
        * Stores results locally for ease of initial setup
        * No MySQL database required to develop, test, and run!
    * Lots of work to get cameras working
        * Basler and IDS camera drivers included
        * Support for still photos and streaming MJPEG video
        * Easy support for adding video stream from camera to web UI
    * Copious usability and stability fixes - here are a few:
        * Lots of cleanup related to tool checking/checkout due to process -> thread change (hooray for thread locks!)
        * Fixes to improve multiplatform support for Python 2 and 3 (developing on Windows 10, Centos 7, and Ubuntu)
        * Changing tool status checks from threads to coroutines to gain better control over the status check execution
            and ward off thread safety issues
        * Disallow operations checking out results and authorization databases so users cannot tamper with results
    * Widespread documentation and style improvements

What's new in Station Exec 0.4.1
================================

June 27, 2018
-------------

::

    * Local/Remote database sync
        * Store results, users, and stations in a local file database
        * If connectivity is available for remote MySQL database, sync local results
        * Prevents loss of data due to loss of connectivity
        * Handles collisions and duplicate data
        * Runs periodically to allow for protection even with an intermittent connection
    * New Developer Tools
        * tool_util class that eases testing of tools
        * Allows developer to launch tools in a context similar to stationexec without the extra bulk
        * Makes debugging and testing tools much easier
    * Copious usability and stability fixes - here are a few:
        * Made tool online/offline status easier to manipulate and all related systems more robust
        * Using new sphinx module to make HTTP API docs look much better and make them easier to read
        * Exception logging made more verbose to give better insight
        * Context manager to make tool checkout/return more intuitive
        * Making sure missing SSL certificates doesn't break software (in case they aren't wanted)
    * Widespread documentation and style improvements
